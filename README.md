# Air Pollution Analysis

This project analyzes air pollution data to classify and understand air quality levels using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and modeling.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Transform raw data into a usable format.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and summarize air pollution data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest) to predict air quality levels.

## Dataset

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and includes:
- Air Quality levels (e.g., `Good`, `Moderate`, `Poor`).
- Additional environmental metrics.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `seaborn`: Data visualization.
- `sklearn`: Machine learning modeling and evaluation.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Download or provide the dataset as specified in the notebook.
3. Run the notebook cell-by-cell to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Visualize trends and distributions.
   - Train and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Results

The notebook provides insights into air quality distribution and a trained model's performance metrics, such as classification accuracy.
